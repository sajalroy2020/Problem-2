*** This problem solving use the Binary Search Algorithm.
 ** Sorting the Array List.
 ** Create a dynamic function. This function input two option (array list and target number).
 ** Binary Search Implementation and create a (left = 0), and (right = nums.length - 1) that means get your last index number.
 ** Make a Binary Search Loop and compare left value and right value that means your (array length).
 ** Then now calculate the middle index mid of the current range.
 ** Then compare your array index or target value.
 ** Then check your target value in array index using (else if).
 ** This target is not found in the array laft value is show that means (0) your out put.
 ** Finaly out your result (console.log(result)).

*** I solve this problem different way, not using the algorithm but My output is the same and working should be fine.
